            <p class="scene-setter">(He goes back into the main room. Unity has disappeared, but there are letters everywhere)<p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Rick: </p>
            <p>Hey Une! You got any more-</p>
            
            <p class="scene-setter">(He picks up a note and reads it. Unity talks in a voiceover, using the voices of different assimilated for each part)<p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Unity (voiceover): </p>
            <p>Rick, forgive me for doing this in notes. I’m not strong enough to do it in persons.</p>
            
            <p class="scene-setter">(Rick starts wandering around town. The entire town is filled with letters. He picks up to read some as he goes)<p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Unity (voiceover): </p>
            <p>I realise now that I'm attracted to you for the same reason I can't be with you. You can't change. And I have no problem with that, but… it clearly means I have a problem with myself.</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Unity (voiceover): </p>
            <p>I’m sure there’s no perfect version of me. I’m sure I’ll just unify species after species and never really be complete.</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Unity (voiceover): </p>
            <p>But I know how it goes with us. I lose who I am and become part of you. Because in a strange way you’re better at what I do without even trying. Yours, and nobody else’s, Unity.</p>
            
            <p class="scene-setter">[Trans. to the Smiths watching TV in the living room. Rick enters from the left]<p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Rick: </p>
            <p>Hey.</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Beth: </p>
            <p>Dad… [clears throat] I… um… Jerry and I were looking for our weed whacker, and found your subterranean lair… and your alien prisoner. And… he got away. And I know I sound like mom but I can’t sacrifice this whole family’s safety just because I’m afraid you’ll leave again, so no more alien prisoners, and, no more subterranean excavation without consulting us.</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Rick: </p>
            <p>Okay.</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Beth: </p>
            <p>...Okay? Y-y-y-y-Okay like you’re gonna quietly teleport somewhere and never come back?</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Rick: </p>
            <p>No. It’s your house.</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Summer: </p>
            <p>Grandpa Rick! What happened… with Unity?</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Rick: </p>
            <p>Who? Oh. Unity. Yeah, well, I mean honestly we’re talking about an entity that thrives on enslavement, you know. It’s not cool. Fun’s fun but who needs it? I’ll be in the garage.</p>

            <p class="scene-setter">(“Do you feel it?” by Chaos Chaos starts playing in the background. Rick enters the garage, looking depressed, and drains his flask before throwing it away. Then he pulls out two bulbs and puts together a metal contraption on the desk. He pulls a frozen alien creature out of the drawers and brings it to life with a flask of chemicals, strokes it while it shrieks helplessly, and drinks the rest of the chemicals. He puts one of the bulbs into the contraption and sticks the alien under it, disintegrating it with a blast of energy, then replaces the bulb and repeats the process with his own head. At the last second, he falls unconscious, dodging the killing blast. The screen zooms out through the open garage door, showing Rick slumped still on the desk through the night and into the morning, even as Jerry shows up, happily weeding the garden and the driveway without noticing Rick.)</p>
