            <p>Hey Rick, I have to make a project for the science fair this weekend. You think you could help me out?</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Rick: </p>
            <p>Whatever.</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Jerry: </p>
            <p>Well, um, traditionally science fairs are a father-son thing.</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Rick: </p>
            <p>Well, scientifically, traditions are an idiot thing.</p>

            <p class="speaker-title">Jerry: </p>
            <p>Yes! You backed the right horse on this one, son! We’ll get out the crayons, brew some coffee and knock this thing out in two or three days.</p>
