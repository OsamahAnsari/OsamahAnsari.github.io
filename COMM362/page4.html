            <div class="transcript-scene">[Trans. Shadow Council of Ricks Hall]</div> <br>

            <div class="transcript-scene">(Rick D. Sanchez III arrives to take his seat next to Steve Jobs Rick.)</div> <br>

            <div class="transcript-speaker">Rick D. Sanchez III:</div> Sorry I'm late, Mr. President. Had a little crisis at work. <br><br>

            <div class="transcript-speaker">Steve Jobs Rick:</div> Worth it! <div class="transcript-action">*Eats Simple Rick wafer cookie; Sees President Morty having a haircut with Barber Rick*</div> <br><br>

            <div class="transcript-speaker">President Morty:</div> It's no problem. <div class="transcript-action">*To Barber Rick*</div> Uh, a little more off the top. <div class="transcript-action">*Continues*</div> You were saying, Garment District Rick? <br><br>

            <div class="transcript-speaker">Garment District Rick:</div> We were saying, <div class="transcript-action">*air-quotes*</div> &quot;President Morty,&quot; that we don't care who sits in that seat. A Rick, a Morty, a goddam Jerry, doesn't matter. We've been running the Citadel since before the Council, and you'll find that we're still running it now. <div class="transcript-action">*President Morty turns over holding a mirror*</div> <br><br>

            <div class="transcript-speaker">President Morty:</div> Does he really speak for everyone here? <br><br>

            <div class="transcript-speaker">Other Ricks:</div> Yeah, yeah. <div class="transcript-action">*President Morty turns back again holding up the mirror*</div> <br>

            <div class="transcript-speaker">President Morty:</div> Well, I think it's important to be clear. Raise your hand if he speaks for you. <br><br>

            <div class="transcript-scene">(Through President Morty's mirror reflection, seven Ricks including Rick D. Sanchez III and Garment District Rick raise their hands for a beat. President Morty snaps his finger and two Officer Ricks euthanise the five Ricks with shock lasers except for Steve Jobs Rick and Good-Looking Rick.)</div> <br>

            <div class="transcript-speaker">Barber Rick:</div> <div class="transcript-action">*Keeping his cool*</div> Is that... enough off the top? <div class="transcript-action">*Three more Officer Ricks enter*</div> <br><br>

            <div class="transcript-speaker">President Morty:</div> I don't know. <div class="transcript-action">*turns over the two remaining Ricks*</div> Is it? <br><br>

            <div class="transcript-speaker">Steve Jobs Rick:</div> <div class="transcript-action">*begging*</div> Yes, yes, yes! Goddamn yes! <br><br>

            <div class="transcript-speaker">Good-Looking Rick:</div> <div class="transcript-action">*begging*</div> Yes, it's great! <br><br>

            <div class="transcript-speaker">President Morty:</div>Good. <br><br>

            <div class="transcript-scene">(President Morty then walks over to pour a glass of brandy as the Officer Ricks and Mortys carry the Rick corpses away. President Morty observes outside the window as he continues his dialogue.)</div> <br>

            <div class="transcript-speaker">President Morty:</div>This seems like a good time for a drink, and a cold, calculated speech with sinister overtones. A speech about politics, about order, brotherhood, power... <br><br>

            <div class="transcript-scene">(Scenes show the new Morty/Rick banners covering the old Rick emblems of a building; Cop Rick putting on his new police badge; Fat, Glasses and Lizard Morty wheelbarrowing Megafruit in their new uniforms; Officer Ricks dragging the remaining dead Ricks into airlock pods. Cut back to President Morty.)</div> <br>

            <div class="transcript-speaker">President Morty:</div>But speeches are for campaigning. *looks into his glass of brandy and gives a sinister expression* Now... is the time for action. <br><br>

            <div class="transcript-scene">[Trans. Ext. Airlock Outside the Citadel]</div> <br>

            <div class="transcript-scene">(Four dead Ricks, including Rick D. Sanchez III and Garment District Rick, are chucked out of the airlock. &quot;For the Damaged Coda&quot; plays in the background as the scene zooms out revealing dozens of dead Ricks and Mortys floating in space including Cop Morty, Big Morty, Investigator Rick and Campaign Manager Morty. The floating documents shows pictures of a Morty with an eyepatch; Candidate Morty taking off his eyepatch with a puppet-controlled Rick before the pictures float away off-screen.)</div> <br>
