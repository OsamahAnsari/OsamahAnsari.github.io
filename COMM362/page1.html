            <p class="speaker-title">(Presumably) All Ricks: </p>
            <p>Okay, we're out of time. It's ironic, huh?</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Morty 30: </p>
            <p>Rick!</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Rick 30: </p>
            <p>What's goin' on?</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Morty 30: </p>
            <p>The collar, oh, the latch is broken! It won't latch closed around my neck!</p>
            
            <p class="scene-setter">(Zoom pan to Timeline 28)</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">(Presumably) All Mortys Except Morty 30: </p>
            <p>What's wrong, how come our collars aren't green?</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">(Presumably) All Ricks Except Rick 30: </p>
            <p>Obviously because someone doesn't know how to put his collar on and one of me is stuck trying to help him.</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">(Presumably) All Mortys Except Morty 30: </p>
            <p>Don't blame this on me, you're the one that couldn't fix a latch!</p>
            
            <p class="scene-setter">(Zoom pan to Timeline 30)</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Rick 30: </p>
            <p>What are you talking about, it's not broken, Morty, I fixed it, just put it on!</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Morty 30: </p>
            <p>It won't close, it's broken!</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Rick 30: </p>
            <p>Fine, bring it here.</p>

            <p class="speaker-title">Morty 30: </p>
            <p>Ooh, ooh, Rick!</p>

            <p class="scene-setter">(Zoom pan to Timeline 15)</p>

            <p class="speaker-title">(Presumably) All Ricks Except Rick 30: </p>
            <p>Oh, really, Morty? Well I'm sorry, I'm not the one that's so fucking uncertain about everything!</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">(Presumably) All Mortys Except Morty 30: </p>
            <p>You know what I'm certain of, Rick? I've really made up my mind about this, I never wanna see you again!</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">(Presumably) All Ricks Except Rick 30: </p>
            <p>You're never gonna see anything again you little dummy! You killed us!</p>

            <p class="speaker-title">Morty 30: </p>
            <p>Ooh, ooh, Rick!</p>

            <p class="scene-setter">(Zoom pan to Timeline 30)</p>

            <p class="speaker-title">Rick 30: </p>
            <p>Goddammit!</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Morty 30: </p>
            <p>Ooh</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Rick 30: </p>
            <p>Morty where's your collar I'll fix it</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Morty 30: </p>
            <p>I dropped it</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">(Presumably) All Ricks Except Rick 30: </p>
            <p>What the hell? What have you done to me, Morty?</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Rick 30: </p>
            <p>I'm okay with this. Be good Morty. Be better than me. Holy shit, the other collar! I'm not okay with this! I am not okay with this! Oh, sweet Jesus please let me live. Oh, my God I—I've gotta fix this thing, please God in Heaven, please, God, oh Lord, hear my prayers. Yes! Fuck you God! Not today, bitch.</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">(Presumably) All Ricks Except Rick 30: </p>
            <p>Please, God, if there's a Hell, please be merciful to me.</p>

            <p class="speaker-title">Rick 30: </p>
            <p>Yes I did it! There is no God! In your face. One dot, motherfuckers!</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Morty: </p>
            <p>Yes, oh, yes, yes!</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Summer: </p>
            <p>Woohoo! Whoo! Whoo!</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Morty: </p>
            <p>Oh, that was a close call. Oh yeah, do it Rick, do it right.</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Rick: </p>
            <p>You know what I'm talking about, oh yeah. I'm gonna do the cabbage patch, Morty. Check me out I'm doing the cabbage patch dance. It's a classic dance, remember, like this. Oh shit look at that.</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Morty: </p>
            <p>Do the cabbage patch. Do—do—do the dance.</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Summer: </p>
            <p>Hey wait a second, how come you guys took longer to get here?</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Morty: </p>
            <p>I don't know. I think like one sixty-fourth of my collars didn't work. It's hard to keep straight now that I have sixty-three other memories of everything.</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Rick: </p>
            <p>Yeah.</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Morty: </p>
            <p>But I feel like one of the sixty-four Ricks like, sacrificed himself for me, maybe, I think.</p>
            
            <p class="speaker-title">Rick: </p>
            <p>Shut up, Morty. The last time you felt something, we all almost died. You little s—piece of shit.</p>
