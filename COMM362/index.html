        <h2>Answer to A4</h2>
        <p>When I zoomed the page, I noticed that the size of the text changed, while the text boxes scaled relatively to maintain the page structure. The red box shrunk to accommodate for the increasing tree root image to maintain the half-page ratio that the two share. Conversely, the text size increased, causing the textbox to expand vertically. The image scaled up when zooming in and down when zooming out. The background whitespace shrunk to accommodate the increased size of the elements. When resizing the page horizontally it followed a similar pattern to zooming, however, generally the textbox shrunk horizontally and elongated vertically. Whereas the image just moved horizontally to the left or right as the textbox resized. However, when I resized vertically, the page did not change, only text at the bottom was cut off when resizing upward, or the text shifted down, when resizing downward. Resizing diagonally resulted in a combination of these two effects.</p>

        <p>The letter 'a' appeared 90 times on the webpage.</p>
        
        <h2>Answer to A7</h2>
        <p>I recognize the all the tags and attributes used in the HTML source code from prior HTML experience and lecture.</p>
        
        <h2>Answer to A9</h2>
        <p>I recognize all the selectors and properties in &quot;part4style.css&quot; from prior CSS experience. The CSS file &quot;part4style.css&quot; differs from the HTML source code because it just defines the properties of the individual elements used in the HTML file. Conversely, the HTML file only defines the contents of the page.</p>
        
        <h2>Answer to A11</h2>
        <p>I originally used the Google Chrome browser. For comparison, I switched to the Microsoft Edge browser. Both of them reacted similarly when zooming and resizing. However, when searching, their prompts showed up differently. On chrome, a little box on the top right appears. However, on Edge, a search bar appears across the entire top under the URL box. Similarly, they are different when it comes to displaying the source code. Chrome opens a new tab with the source code displayed. However, Microsoft Edge opens the developer tools on the right side of the screen and shows the source code in one of the subwindows.</p>
